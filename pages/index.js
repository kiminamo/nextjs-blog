  My name is Kimberly Guevarra Manaloto, and I am 20 years old. I have a passion for editing and photography. <br />
  I chose to study IT because technology has always fascinated me, and I want to create things <br />
  that make people's lives easier. After graduation, I hope to become a <br />
  software developer and work on projects that help businesses or individuals. In this subject, I expect to gain a deeper <br />
  understanding of programming languages and tools for building better software. I would also love <br />
  to learn more about front-end design, user experience, and cloud technologies.
